## Production builds

Both `@splunk/react-icons` and React support production and development builds. The production build removes warnings and guidance from the output. To create a production build, set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `"production"` and use the webpack [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/) to inject the variable into the code.
