Standardized webpack configuration files for apps and components.

## Install

Install the package and its dependencies.

1. Install the peer dependencies:
    ```
    npm install --save-dev @babel/core@^7 babel-loader@^8 webpack@^4
    ```
2. Install the package:
    ```
    npm install --save-dev @splunk/webpack-configs
    ```

## Usage

### Base Configuration

```
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');
const baseConfig = require('@splunk/webpack-configs').default;

module.exports = webpackMerge(baseConfig, {
    entry: {...},
    output: {...},
});
```

### Component Library

A configuration for building a library of shareable components.
```
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');
const baseComponentConfig = require('@splunk/webpack-configs/component.config').default;

module.exports = webpackMerge(baseComponentConfig, {
entry: {...},
output: {...},
});
```

### Dashboard Extensions

```
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');
const baseDashboardConfig = require('@splunk/webpack-configs/dashboard.config').default;

module.exports = webpackMerge(baseDashboardConfig, {
    entry: {...},
    output: {...},
});
```

`@splunk/dashboard-extension-webpack-plugin` must be added as a dev dependency if this configuration is used.

### Options

All configurations export a `create` function that accepts the following options:
* `babelTypescript` - Includes `.ts` and `.tsx` files in the `babel-loader` configuration used by
all configurations. Defaults to `true`.

```
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');
const createBaseConfig = require('@splunk/webpack-configs').create;

module.exports = webpackMerge(createBaseConfig({ babelTypescript: false }), {
    entry: {...},
    output: {...},
});
```
