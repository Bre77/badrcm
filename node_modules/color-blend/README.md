> Blends RGBA colors with different blend modes

This is a zero-dependency JavaScript implementation of the blend modes introduced in the [W3C Compositing and Blending spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/).

Altogether it's a whopping 1.1 KB small (minified & gzipped), going down to as far as 0.4 KB if you use just one blending method and a [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking) bundler.

## Install

```console
$ npm install --save color-blend
```

## Usage

### Example

It's really easy to wrap your head around. Consider the following simple example:

```js
// Using vanilla Node.js
const { normal } = require('color-blend')

// Using a bundler? It will automatically pick up a
// tree-shakeable ES modules version of color-blend:
import { normal } from 'color-blend'

// Mix some green and pink
const pinkBackground = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 87, a: 0.42 }
const greenForeground = { r: 70, g: 217, b: 98, a: 0.6 }

normal(pinkBackground, greenForeground)
// returns { r: 110, g: 170, b: 96, a: 0.768 }
```

By the way, those are the colors from the logo above. See?

### Explanation

This module provides an implementation for all blend modes listed in the aforementioned W3C document, which are:

- `normal`
- `multiply`
- `screen`
- `overlay`
- `darken`
- `lighten`
- `colorDodge`
- `colorBurn`
- `hardLight`
- `softLight`
- `difference`
- `exclusion`
- `hue`
- `saturation`
- `color`
- `luminosity`

All those methods have the same API: they take a `background` and a `foreground` color as arguments.
Those are expected to be RGBA colors, similar to how they appear in CSS â€” represented as plain objects containing the keys

- `r`, `g`, `b` (each ranging from 0 to 255)
- `a` (ranging from 0 to 1)

The result of the blending operation will be returned as such an RGBA object as well.

### Unit Colors

If you need higher precision (resulting RGB channels will be rounded to integers!) or just have a different flavor, this package offers the `/unit` entry point, where all accepted and returned color channels are values between 0 and 1:

```javascript
import { normal } from 'color-blend/unit'

// Still mix some green and pink
const pinkBackground = { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0.34, a: 0.42 }
const greenForeground = { r: 0.27, g: 0.85, b: 0.38, a: 0.6 }

normal(pinkBackground, greenForeground)
// returns { r: 0.43, g: 0.665, b: 0.372, a: 0.768 } (rounded to 3 decimals for brevity)
```
